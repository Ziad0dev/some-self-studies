## 8. Mental Models for Speed

### 8.1. Problem Classification Speed
**Within 30 seconds, ask:**
1. What's the primary data structure involved?
2. What's the constraint that guides algorithm choice?
3. Have I seen a similar problem before?
4. What's the most likely time complexity needed?

### 8.2. Implementation Speed Tricks
#### Template Code Patterns
```python
# DFS Template
def dfs(node, visited, result):
    if not node or node in visited:
        return
    visited.add(node)
    # Process node
    for neighbor in node.neighbors:
        dfs(neighbor, visited, result)

# BFS Template
def bfs(start):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = {start}
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        # Process node
        for neighbor in node.neighbors:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)

# Binary Search Template
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1

    return -1
```
